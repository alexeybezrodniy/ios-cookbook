### 3. Xcode Instruments

Xcode instruments is a set of powerful tools to use **while** developing apps for iOS/macOS. Although we were tempted to dive deep into every one of them, not all of them are necessary on a day-to-day basis. Instead, lets cover ones that should be used to test and debug every app.

#### View Hierarchy Debugger

View Debugger is a cool feature that provides an interactive way to visualize view hierarchies. It is useful for identifying problems with layouts that can‚Äôt be identified looking at a flat screen.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Often, when you're having problems with your UI layout it's worth checking in with the view hierarchy. All unexpected layout issues (like constraint ambiguity) will be displayed there.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When selecting a view in the hierarchy, it is automatically highlighted in the 3D representation. But if you see something unknown and weird in the 3D view, you have to press **‚áß‚åòD** to reveal it in the hierarchy

üíÅ It's really helpful to give your views an accessibility identifier to easily find them in the view hierarchy. The hierarchy displays objects by their class names, so if you're working with, say, `MyCoolView` and other subclasses of UIView - you're going to see names of these subclasses in the hierarchy. But if you're working with plain `UIView`'s - it's going to be hard to know which is which. By adding accessibility identifiers to you `UIViews` you can easily identify <sub>(get it? identifier -> identify haha)</sub> multiple views in the hierarchy by going into the Object inspector -> Accessibility. 

```swift
redView.accessibilityIdentifier = "RedView"
```

Plus, by doing this, if you ever run into an "UnsatisfiableConstraints" error - you're going to get the identifiers of the problematic views printed with their addresses. Neat!

#### Time Profiler

The Time Profiler instrument gives insights into the system‚Äôs CPUs and how effective multiple cores and threads are used. Basically - how good your app is performing.

‚ùïAlways profile on a physical device, because your mac has a lot more horsepower

Use example:

- You made a super nice UICollectionView with pictures loaded from some API + a photo filter applied to each photo

- Everything looks great, but you notice the collectionView is not smooth as you want it to be üßà

- You build the project for profiling (‚åò+I), fire up the Time Profiler, press record and perform some scrolling in the collectionView

- After recording, you tick the "Separate by Thread" and "Hide System Libraries" settings in the call tree

  ![](resources/debugging/timeProfiler1.png)

- You notice that the main thread is loaded up to 49% by your "withTonalFilter" function. That's the photo filter!

- You go into the function declaration and send this bad boi to a background thread, so that he no longer blocks the collectionView layout on the main thread

Call tree settings:

- **Separate by State**: groups results by your app‚Äôs lifecycle state. It is useful when you have some stuff going on in the background
- **Separate by Thread**: lets you understand which threads are responsible for the greatest amount of CPU use
- **Invert Call Tree**: makes the top-level methods visible without having to click through each call tree.
- **Hide System Libraries**: only shows symbols from your own app. It‚Äôs often useful to select this option since you can‚Äôt do much about how much CPU the system libraries are using.
- **Flatten Recursion**: shows recursive functions with one entry in each stack trace, rather than multiple times.
- **Top Functions**: makes Instruments consider the total time spent in a function as the sum of the time within that function, as well as the time spent in functions called by that function. So if function A calls B, then Instruments reports A‚Äôs time as the time spent in A plus the time spent in B

#### Allocations

This instrument helps you find abandoned memory that is no longer needed, but is not released.

Generally, you'd want to make sure that all your objects are released from memory during development. A useful method is to have a deinit call in your view controllers with a print statement just to make sure that nothing is holding on to this VC after dismissal. A typical example is failing to `invalidate()` a repeating Timer object, thus, creating a strong reference cycle.

```swift
deinit {
  print("VeryNiceViewController deinit üßπ")
}
```

The allocations graph displays how much memory your app is using while running. Typically, even if your app is doing some resource-heavy work ‚Äì eventually these resources have to be released from memory. If this doesn't happen ‚Äì you will clearly see it on the graph.

Lets look at an example

<img src="resources/debugging/allocations2.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

With the allocation instrument running we performed 3 image searches by keyword, and displayed each result in a collectionView on the `SearchResultsViewController`. By typing the name of our process in the filter we can see objects from our app only. We notice that 3 instances of `SearchResultsViewController` and 63 cells are persistent in memory. That's not right!

The Transient column shows the number of objects that existed but have since been deallocated. In this case, we should have only 1 persistent VC, and the other "used" 2 - should be transient.

![](resources/debugging/allocations1.png)

Here we launched the allocations instrument, ran our app, and started performing repeating actions (the same as in the last example). After each "run" - we flagged this point in time with "mark generation". After conducting 6 searches we clearly see that memory is only growing (by ~8MB each run!) and not being released. Expanding the generations and looking into the stack trace will let us identify the methods that are responsible for holding on to memory (developer initiated stack traces are highlighted and marked with a blue "person" icon).

‚ùïIt is sometimes usefull to force iOS to release some memory by simulating a memory warning (*Document ‚ñ∏ Simulate Memory Warning*). This tells the system frameworks to release memory so you can be absolutely sure that the memory leak is your fault üôÉ

We identified the problem, and we can now track it down by looking into the stack trace and find the faulty methods. But to go even deeper, we can look into the Xcode memory debugger.

#### Visual Memory Debugger

The Visual Memory Debugger pauses your app and displays a visual representation of objects in memory and the references between them.

‚ùïTo see the backtrace of the objects in the debugger, Malloc stack logging has to be enabled (Edit scheme -> Run -> Diagnostics -> Malloc stack logging + Live allocations only)

After you ran and used your app for a couple of cycles, go ahead and smash that Debug Memory Graph button. Usually, the first thing to do is to check whether Xcode found some obvious leaks for us. To do that ‚Äì find the little ‚ö†Ô∏è button at the bottom of the Debug navigator pane (in the "filter" textfield). This will highlight the leaked blocks that Xcode found for us. Nice, but what do you do when Xcode doesn't see anything but your app is eating memory like it's tomato soup from Very Well Cafe?

The Debug navigator pane shows the list of all types and instances allocated in memory at the moment you paused your app. By looking at it we can again see that we have 105 collectionView cells and 4 SearchResultsVCs being held in memory.

<img src="resources/debugging/memGraph1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Lets click on one of the SearchResultsVC instances. Xcode will show a pretty big graph of that instance and any references to it. We can see that there is a big ammount of closures referencing the same instance of our VC.

<img src="resources/debugging/memGraph2.png" style="zoom:40%;" />

If you select the arrow pointing to the VC and open the Utilities pane you will see that the reference type is "strong". The type of reference from the collectionViewCell to the closure is also strong. Lets select the cell to see where it is declared. 

<img src="resources/debugging/memGraph3.png" style="zoom:60%;" />

Tapping on that small arrow will take us exactly to the place where this cell was declared. And somewhere nearby there is a closure that captures a strong reference to the SearchResultsVC and doesn't release it from memory. Make it weak and you're done. üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### Battery

It's pretty obvious that you should inspect the Energy Log on a real device, but also it's best to do that wirelessly. You can either connect the device via network (Xcode -> Devices and simulators -> Connect via network), but for the most accurate results you can save the energy log on the device and then import it into Xcode. 
For info on how to do that, check this [Instruments Help](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/current/#/dev03a7149d) page
